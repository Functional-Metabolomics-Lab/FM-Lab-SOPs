# Standard Operating Procedure: Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC)

### Author: Paolo Stincone
### Last Modified: March 31 2022

### Microorganisms:
bacteria, fungi

### Broth Medium:
(BHI) Brain Heart Infusion, Mueller–Hinton, etc.
### Compound Stock Solution:
Antimicrobial compounds dissolved in water in a concentration higher than the used as highest concentration to test. The stock solution quantity should include the antimicrobial needs for the following planned analysis after MIC value definition.
Other materials: Sterile filter 0.22µm to filter the test compound solution; Sterile Saline solution (0.86% NaCl) for bacteria macro-dilutions; Sterile tubes for both bacteria number definition ( 106CFU/mL) and stock sterile antimicrobials, sterile tips, sterile 96 well-plate.

### Procedure

1)      Add 175 µL of chosen medium broth in all the wells
2)      Using a multichannel pipette, add 175 µL of the testing compound solution (max. concentration) in (H)
3)      Pipetting Up-Down (3 times) for mixing medium and antimicrobial
4)      Take 175 µL from (H) and add it in (G), repeat the 3)
5)      Continue with the point 3) and 4) until line (B)
6)      (B) wells include the low concentration tested
7)      (A) wells represent negative control, add the highest concentration of the eventual used solvent to dissolve the antimicrobial (DMSO, MeOH etc.)
8)      Add 17,5 µL (105CFU/mL final) in each well of the plate with the exception of the line 12 column that will be considered an indicator for possible contamination.
   
Mix the wells content per 2 min at 220 rpm (inside incubator with rotational movement) before, then pass the plate inside incubator at 35-37°C for 16-24 hours, make sure to close the plate with parafilm to avoid the evaporation.              
The plate can be read with the spectrophotometer “Epoch” after reservation with the Link lab booking system. The MIC value is defined as the lowest antimicrobial concentration in which no turbidity of the medium is observed, and it is expressed in μg/mL.
Advise: Carry out the experiment inside the Clean Bench to avoid contamination.
To make the desired max concentration to test from the stock solution, use the following formula: C1*V1=C2*V2
